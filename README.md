# Description
This template allows you to setup an AWS amplify web application with secure authentication using AWS [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) in minutes. The result is a Bootstrap styled user interface that allows an user to sign up, signout, login, reset password and redirects them to a 'secret' page that will in turn redirect unauthenticated users.
